# SolidWorks-RealView-Enabler

SolidWorks RealView Enabler is an easy to use, C# based Command Prompt Application that identifies your versions of Solidworks installed and your Graphics Card,
and applies the necessary Workarounds changes your Solidworks Key Registry files need to enable the Real View graphics rendering mode
for a better 3D CAD experience.

Launch the, "SolidWorks Realview Enabler.exe" and it will do everything for you. 
You can delete the RealView Enabler application as soon as it's done its job.

Since this application looks into the Key Registry and I am not a, "known publisher," it might trigger virus security concerns. I included the source code. Feel free to compile it yourself! It's not a virus or harmful to your computer in any way. 

"SolidWorks Realview Enabler.exe" is built to work with any version of SolidWorks needed until Dassault Syst√®mes fixes this error. 
RealView Enabler can apply the patch to multiple versions of SolidWorks installed on your computer. 
It will not alter any other SolidWorks preferences/settings.
